# Fractals

Welcome to the Chaos Game. The game is played with three coloured points in a triangle, and a single starting point somewhere in the middle. (It doesn't actually matter exactly where.) To play, select a random color, and then colour the point exactly half way between the starting point and the vertex of the chosen colour. This midpoint becomes the new starting point, and the process is repeated. <br/>
Constructing and colouring points in this way gradually makes a pattern inside the triangle. Can you guess what this pattern will be?

In settings.py you can edit start_point end triangle_points coordinates. <br/>
Install Tkinter and run main.py to start Chaos Game.
